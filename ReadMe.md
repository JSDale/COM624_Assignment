# COM 624 Assignment

## Abstract

In this assignment I had to create an application that used machine learning to predict future stock prices.

## Technology Used

I plan to use python 3.9 for the backend, implementing a message broker. This gives flexibility for the 
front end. I plan to use a simple C# GUI for the technical demonstrator. The python backend will run in a docker
container.

## How to run the application



## How to run application in dev environment

I used pycharm to create the python backend, wit a virtual environment. To get you up and running with the dependancies,
I also included a requirements.txt file.

- First, run ```sh python3 -m venv <filepath of virtual env you want>```
- Then, run ```sh <filepath of virtual env you want>\Scripts\activate```
- Finally, enter ```sh pip install -r <filepath of project>\requirements.txt```
